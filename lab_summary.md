# Lab Summary

<!-- DRAFT: edit this so it describes what actually happened in your run. -->

The main challenge was keeping the two-provider chain reliable: a failure at either step should not lose the article. I solved this with the training patterns: each provider runs behind a circuit breaker with jittered retry, the other provider takes over when that fails, and a failed article is logged without stopping the batch. Costs come from the exact token counts each API returns, tracked in the TokenBudgetManager. Mocking the APIs in the unit tests let me test failure paths (provider down, budget exceeded, both providers failing) without spending credits. I learned that chaining providers creates a dependency: the sentiment step depends on the summary step, so the quality of the first output caps the second. Improvements I would make: cache processed URLs, store results in SQLite, and alert when the fallback rate rises, because frequent fallback is an early sign of a provider issue.
